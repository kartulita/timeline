# Timeline TODO

 * "Go to day" button in timeline

 * "scope.gotoDay(date)" method in timeline-days

 * Give timeline-days its own controller

    * Maybe move the scroll logic there too, or to a separate directive/controller pair.

 * timeline-item onclick handler - implement a separate viewer directive that can be triggered by the timeline on click / on new show starting.

 * timeline-item as separate directive (item, not the container)

 * Add item buttons (Play and the Now Playing) to timeline-item
